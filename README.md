ScringoCustomizedSample-iOS
===========================

This sample contains all the libraries it requires, including __Scringo__ and Facebook SDK.

To make it work you need to:  
1. Download the sample.  
2. Open with Xcode.  
3. Replace @"YOUR SCRINGO APP ID" in __AppDelegate.m__ with your Scringo App Id (See below how to obtain it if you don't have one already).  
4. If you're interested in Facebook integration, add your Facebook App Id in __SampleCustomUI-Info.plistt__ (See below how to do that).  
5. Run.  

You can 'play' with __Scringo__'s customization by either modifying already implemented customization methods or adding new one in __SampleScringoStyleSheet.m__.

To obtain a __Scringo__ App Id you need to sign up with __Scringo__ and create your first App. Follow the instructions in http://docs.scringo.com/ios-guides/hello/ to achieve that.

To define and use Facebook SDK within the App you need to follow the instructions listed here https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/.

Good Luck
